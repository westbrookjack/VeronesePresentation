VeronesePresentation
====================

VeronesePresentation is a Macaulay2 package that computes minimal presentations of Veronese subrings
of graded polynomial or quotient rings. It uses a hybrid pipeline that combines Macaulay2 with a custom
C++ backend for efficient Normaliz computations.

Directory Structure
-------------------

- m2/       - Macaulay2 package source (VeronesePresentation.m2)
- src/      - C++ source and header files
- bin/      - Compiled binary full_pipeline (auto-generated by make)
- test/     - Sample test files in Macaulay2
- setup.m2  - Optional setup script to build the binary
- Makefile  - Compiles the C++ pipeline

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone the repository and build the binary:

    git clone https://github.com/yourname/VeronesePresentation.git
    cd VeronesePresentation
    make

Alternatively, you can build the binary from Macaulay2:

    load "setup.m2"

2. Load the package in Macaulay2:

    needsPackage("VeronesePresentation", FileName => "m2/VeronesePresentation.m2")

3. Run a simple example:

    R = QQ[x, y, z, Degrees => {{2}, {3}, {5}}];
    (phi, S) = veronesePresentation(R, 6, VariableName => "v");
    phi -- the presentation map
    S   -- the Veronese subring

Why Use This?
-------------

- Modular design for easy extension
- Fast C++ backend for lattice/Hilbert basis computation
- Works with weighted graded rings
- Optional input `VariableName` allows variable name customization
- Designed for research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra

This project was developed by Jack Westbrook as part of the 2025 REU program in mathematics at the
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. It was supervised by Austyn Simpson, who suggested the core idea
of computing minimal Veronese presentations. All implementation and algorithm design is by Jack Westbrook.

This project includes a custom C++ backend using a modified version of Normaliz for computing Hilbert bases
in sublattices.
