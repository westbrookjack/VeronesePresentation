# VeronesePresentation

VeronesePresentation is a Macaulay2 package that computes minimal presentations of Veronese subrings of graded polynomial or quotient rings. It uses a hybrid pipeline that combines Macaulay2 with a custom C++ backend for efficient Hilbert basis computations.

## Directory Structure

- m2/       - Macaulay2 package source (VeronesePresentation.m2)
- src/      - C++ source and header files
- bin/      - Compiled binary full_pipeline (auto-generated by make)
- test/     - Sample test files in Macaulay2
- setup.m2  - Optional setup script to build the binary
- Makefile  - Compiles the C++ pipeline

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository and build the binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/VeronesePresentation.git
cd VeronesePresentation
make
```

Alternatively, you can build the binary from Macaulay2:

```macaulay2
load "setup.m2"
```

### 2. Load the package in Macaulay2:

```macaulay2
needsPackage("VeronesePresentation", FileName => "m2/VeronesePresentation.m2")
```

### 3. Run a simple example:

```macaulay2
R = QQ[x, y, z, Degrees => {{2}, {3}, {5}}];
(phi, S) = veronesePresentation(R, 6);
phi -- the presentation map
S   -- the Veronese subring
```

## Why Use This?

- Modular design for easy extension
- Fast C++ backend for lattice/Hilbert basis computation
- Works with weighted graded rings
- Designed for research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra
